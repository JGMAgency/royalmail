This repository contains the source code for the Meanbee Royal Mail Magento module.

The main reasons we've put the repository up here is to:

* to offer a resource for budding Magento developers
* encourage members of the development community to contribute to the development of the module
    * improve test coverage
    * improve the structure of the code
    * add additional methods to the module
* ..and to be completely transparent with the code that's being installed on customer installations
    
Enjoy!

* We've not got the update prices for Standard Parcel's insurance options yet, so haven't updated those.
